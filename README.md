## Installing Plugins
The way plugins are installed are by,
1. Use `plug#begin()` and `plug#end()` enclosing all your plugins in a block.
2. Typing in, ``Plug '*<link to the plugin github repository>*' to add the plugin to the `.vimrc`.
3. Running, `:PlugInstall` to install the plugin after which refreshing the editor should do the trick.
